![Cover Image](../assets/images/projects/streaming-pipeline.jpg)

## Overview
Real-time data processing pipeline using streaming technologies. Handles high-volume data streams with low latency.

## Technologies
- Apache Kafka
- Apache Spark
- Python
- Redis
- Elasticsearch

## Features
- Real-time data ingestion
- Stream processing
- Low-latency transformations
- Scalable architecture
- Monitoring and metrics
- Fault tolerance

## Description
A real-time streaming data pipeline that processes high-volume data streams with minimal latency. Built with Apache Kafka for message queuing and Apache Spark for stream processing.

The pipeline ingests data from various sources, applies transformations in real-time, and outputs results to multiple destinations. It's designed to handle millions of events per second while maintaining reliability.

## Challenges
- Managing streaming state
- Ensuring exactly-once processing
- Handling backpressure
- Optimizing for low latency

## Learnings
- Kafka architecture and configuration
- Spark Streaming concepts
- Stream processing patterns
- Distributed systems design
